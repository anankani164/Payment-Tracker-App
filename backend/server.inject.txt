Add these two lines to your backend/server.js:

1) At the top with other imports:
   import registerClientStatementRoutes from './routes/clientStatements.js';

2) After your DB and auth middleware are set up (near where other routes are registered):
   registerClientStatementRoutes(app, db, auth);

Commit server.js after inserting those lines.
